// ZERO SUM GAMES
// Pure competition type games - no cooperation between players
// P1: 5pts, P2: -5pts
// From wikipedia:
// A mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants.
// Totals gains - Total losses = 0
// Generic Zero-Sum Game
//            Choice 1       Choice 2
// Choice 1   -A, A          B, -B
// Choice 2    C, -C         -D, D
// 
// Any result of a zero-sum situation is Pareto optimal - any game where all strategies are Pareto optimal is called a conflict game. 
// 
// Tic Tac Toe is a zero-sum game so the AI can spend its life minimizing X's score while maximizing its own score
